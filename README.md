# dynamic-dashboard
An example of how to use a framework to dynamically generate components from data.

If you want so see a live view of the app, click on the Github Pages example in the repo description. If you want to edit the code in a WYSIWYG check out [this vizhub demo](https://beta.vizhub.com/Razpudding/dcffa6b746ac4d1c8207aab5497ae57c)(I can't promise it will be up-to-date with the latest changes).

## Concept
I want to show students how to use a front-end framework to dynamically generate components from a data source. One useful example would be to create visualizations from a data source.
I'll try to set out a simple example of how to do that here. If time permits, it will include soms d3 visualizations, if not, just a component generation pattern.
I've chosen not to use any build tools so as to try to limit the overhead and environment software needed to understand this project. Let's see how that goes.

- It's not possible to use single-file Vue components without a proper build environment like node. This forces you to write html in js... Yes I know about template strings and no, I don't think they're a real substitute. 
- I'm using a # router to enable a SPA-like experience. Proper routing would be nice but it would mean loading different html files which is annoying without node packages.
- Ah I've just realized what would be a nice option.
    + Have a property on the Vue instance that keeps track of the currentTheme
    + If no theme is selected, the main 'themes' page will be shown
    + if a theme-link is clicked, the currentTheme var should be updated
    + That will trigger a v-if which wraps the theme-page component. It will bind the currentTheme to the component's props.
    + The main 'themes' page will be visible depending on whether currentTheme is null ðŸŽ¬
- It might be a good idea to keep this to a Vue+ Loading data example and leave more complex datavisualizations for a separate example. The app could work like this
    + Load some data in a vue method(for instance from a SPARQL endpoint as my students will be using that)
    + Show different aspects of that data on different detail pages.
    + Have a detailpage for each data entry
    + Have some overviewpages showing different aspects (like images, year created etc)


## Outline
- A json file is loaded with some data
- Vue is used to generate components using that data
- Different views are created of the data (each on their own page)
- The different views are presented using a d3 datavisualization
